# Bezier-curve
I was preparing for math presentation for my high school math class.
While making the it, I thought it'd be cool to visualize it like this.


>Since this thing does not rely on Bernoulli polynomial, it cannot keep up with the number of increasing points. (only 4 points)

So, Simply, what this thing does is this;
if you press the 'RUN' button with 4 points assigned, you will get the shape of the Bezier curve.
When you press the 'Kappa' button (which looks like "K"), it will show you
the curvature of the bezier curve. After you close it, it will pop another window which
visualizes the curvature by showing you bunch of circles that are matching on the point of the curve.
